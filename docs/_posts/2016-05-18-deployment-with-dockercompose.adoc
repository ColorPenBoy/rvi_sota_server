Docker is a great way to get SOTA running in a clean, reproducible way. sbt can build and publish local docker images to test with, and docker-compose combined with some ATS-provided images makes sure all of SOTA's dependencies are taken care of.

There are three docker-compose files included in the git repo, under `/deploy/docker-compose`:

* `server-bare.yml` contains all of the SOTA server components, with client communication disabled.
* `server-rvi.yml` contains the server components plus the server-side RVI node, for communication with clients.
* `server-rvi-client.yml` contains the server components, the server-side RVI node, plus a debug build of the SOTA client

As long as you have docker-compose 1.6 or higher, you should be able to run these with `docker-compose -p sota -f [filename].yml`. They will pull docker images from ATS Docker Hub respositories by default; you'll generally want to replace the component you're working on with a local version. `sbt docker:publishLocal` will give you docker images for the three main components. You can then modify the YAML files to point to your local images instead.

If you want to deploy to the cloud, docker-compose can also help you do that. The easiest way is to use https://docs.docker.com/machine/drivers/aws/[docker-machine's AWS driver] to create and deploy to a remote host.
